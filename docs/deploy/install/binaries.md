# Install binaries

You can install and use GoQuorum and Tessera using Docker containers, building from source, or by downloading pre-built release binaries.

## Release binaries

The pre-compiled release binaries for GoQuorum and Tessera can be downloaded from the following links:

- [Quorum](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum/releases)
- [Tessera](https://github.com/ConsenSys/tessera/releases)

Once downloaded, add the binaries to the `PATH` environment variable to make them easier to run.

## Build from source

### GoQuorum

:::note

We recommend installing from official [containers](./docker-and-compose.md) or [release binaries](#release-binaries) rather than building from source. If you build from source, use Go version 1.15 or later.

:::

1. Clone the repository and build the source:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Consensys/quorum.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd quorum
   ```

   ```bash
   make all
   ```

   Binaries are placed in `$REPO_ROOT/build/bin`. Add that folder to the `PATH` environment variable to make `geth` and `bootnode` easier to run, or copy those binaries to a folder already in `PATH`, for example `/usr/local/bin`.

   :::info

   An easy way to supplement `PATH` is to add `PATH=$PATH:/path/to/repository/build/bin` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_aliases` file.

   :::

2. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

### Tessera

Follow the installation instructions on the Tessera project page](https://github.com/ConsenSys/tessera).
