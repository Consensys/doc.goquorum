# Using multi-tenancy via multiple private states

Use [multi-tenancy via multiple private states (MPS)](../../../concepts/multi-tenancy.md) to allow multiple tenants to use the same GoQuorum node, with each tenant having its own private state(s).

## Configure multi-tenancy via multiple private states

### Prerequisites

- Tessera version `21.4.0` or later installed
- GoQuorum version `21.4.2` or later installed

:::caution

If running an earlier GoQuorum or Tessera version, upgrade your existing nodes to enable MPS and multi-tenancy using the [migration guide](migration.md).

:::

### Steps

1.  Set `isMPS` to `true` in the `config` item of the [GoQuorum genesis file](../../configure/genesis-file/genesis-options.md).

    :::tip MPS configuration

    ```json
    {
      "config": {
        ...
        "isMPS": true
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

    :::

    :::note

    There can be a mix of MPS-enabled and non-MPS-enabled nodes in a network.

    :::

2.  Configure the [JSON-RPC security plugin](../json-rpc-api-security.md#configuration). This requires configuring an authorization server. View [examples of configuring the plugin to work with different OAuth2 authorization servers](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-security-plugin-enterprise/tree/master/examples).

3.  Set [`enableMultiplePrivateStates`](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Multiple-private-state/#multiple-private-states) to `true` in the Tessera configuration file. The default is `false`.

    :::caution

    GoQuorum can't start if `isMPS` is `true` in the GoQuorum configuration and `enableMultiplePrivateStates` is `false` in the Tessera configuration.

    GoQuorum runs as a non-MPS-enabled node if `isMPS` is `false` and `enableMultiplePrivateStates` is `true`.

    :::

4.  [Configure `residentGroups`](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Multiple-private-state/#resident-groups) in the Tessera configuration file.

5.  Run GoQuorum with the [`--multitenancy`](../../../reference/cli-syntax.md#multitenancy) command line option.

    ```bash
    geth [OPTIONS] --multitenancy --plugins file:///<path>/<to>/plugins.json
    ```

    In the command, `plugins.json` is the [plugin settings file](../../../develop/develop-plugins.md) that contains the [JSON-RPC Security plugin definition](../../../develop/develop-plugins.md#plugindefinition).

    For example, if you use [quorum-security-plugin-enterprise](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-security-plugin-enterprise), `plugins.json` looks like the following:

    ```json title="plugins.json"
    {
      "providers": {
        "security": {
          "name": "quorum-security-plugin-enterprise",
          "version": "0.1.1",
          "config": "/path/to/config.json"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Configure custom scopes

A network operator must configure [scope values](../../../concepts/multi-tenancy.md#access-token-scope) for each user in an authorization server, for each tenant.

### Example

This example network contains four nodes. Multi-tenant `Node1` is shared between tenant `J` and `G` (`isMPS=true`) and single-tenant `Node2` is used by tenant `D` alone (`isMPS=false`).

:::note

A node consists of a GoQuorum client and Tessera private transaction manager. We name privacy manager key pairs for easy referencing, for example: `J_K1` or `G_K1`. In reality, their values are the pubic keys used in the `privateFor` and `privateFrom` fields.

:::

Tenants are assigned to multi-tenant nodes as follows:

- `J Organization` owns `J_K1` and `J_K2`, and its tenancy is on `Node1`.
- `G Organization` owns `G_K1` and `G_K2`, and its tenancy is on `Node1`.
- `D Organization` owns `D_K1`, and its tenancy is on `Node2`.

In practice, `J Organization` and `G Organization` may decide to allocate keys to their departments, therefore the security model may be as follows:

- `J Organization`:
  - `J Investment` has access to `J` tenancy using any self-managed Ethereum accounts.
  - `J Settlement` has access to `J` tenancy using node-managed Ethereum account `J_ACC1` and a self-managed `Wallet1`.
- `G Organization`:
  - `G Investment` has access to `G` tenancy using any self-managed Ethereum accounts.
  - `G Settlement` has access to `G` tenancy using node-managed Ethereum account `G_ACC1` and self-managed `Wallet2`.

Each authorization server has its own configuration steps and client onboarding process. A network operator's responsibility is to implement this security model in the authorization server by defining [custom scopes](../../../concepts/multi-tenancy.md#access-token-scope) and granting them to target clients.

A custom scope representing `J Investment` is:

```text
psi://J?self.eoa=0x0
```

A custom scope representing `G Settlement` is:

```text
psi://G?node.eoa=G_ACC1&self.eoa=Wallet2
```

Clients must also be granted scopes which specify access to the JSON-RPC APIs:

```text
rpc://eth_*
```

Refer to the [JSON-RPC security plugin documentation](../../../reference/plugins/security.md#oauth2-scopes) for more information.

## Add a new tenant to multi-tenant node

Use the following steps to add a new tenant to a multi-tenant node:

1. The network administrator executes Tessera keygen to generate a new key.

1. Update the Tessera configuration file to include the new key in a [resident group](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Multiple-private-state/#resident-groups).

1. Restart Tessera to load the new key. Startup fails if the new key is generated but not added to a resident group.

1. Make updates to the [authorization server](#configure-custom-scopes) to provide the new tenant access to the private state defined in the resident groups configuration.

## API methods

Use the [`eth_getMPS`](../../../reference/api-methods.md#eth_getpsi) JSON-RPC API method to get the private state the user is operating on.
