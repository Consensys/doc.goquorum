# Cakeshop

[Cakeshop](https://github.com/ConsenSys/cakeshop) is a set of tools and APIs for working with Ethereum, packaged as a Java web application archive (WAR) that gets you up and running quickly.

Out of the box you get:

- **Blockchain explorer** - View transactions, blocks, and contracts, and see historical contract state at a point in time.
- **Node info** - View the overall status of your network.
- **Peer management** - Discover, add, and remove peers.
- **Enhanced permissions UI** - Manage [enhanced network permissioning](../../concepts/permissions-overview.md#enhanced-network-permissioning).
- **Solidity sandbox** - Develop, compile, deploy, and interact with Solidity smart contracts.
- **Contract registry** - Keep track of deployed contracts and their code, interfaces, and state.

You can access Cakeshop when using the [Quorum Developer Quickstart](https://github.com/ConsenSys/cakeshop#running-with-the-quorum-dev-quickstart), with [Spring Boot](https://github.com/ConsenSys/cakeshop#running-via-spring-boot), or with [Docker](https://github.com/ConsenSys/cakeshop#running-via-docker).
