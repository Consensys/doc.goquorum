# Quorum Reporting

[Quorum Reporting](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-reporting) is a tool that provides APIs for generating reports
about contracts deployed to your GoQuorum network.
You can access Quorum Reporting when using the [Quorum Developer Quickstart](../../Tutorials/Quorum-Dev-Quickstart/Getting-Started.md)
or by following the instructions on the repository [README](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-reporting#readme).

Once a contract is registered, you can use Quorum Reporting to inspect the transactions related to that contract and see
how the state of the contract has changed over time.

To access Quorum Reporting for your GoQuorum Quickstart network:

1. [Start the Quorum Developer Quickstart with GoQuorum](../../Tutorials/Quorum-Dev-Quickstart/Using-the-Quickstart.md),
   selecting default monitoring.
1. Open the Reporting UI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   The RPC API runs at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
