# Splunk

[Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4866/#/details) is a third-party monitoring solution that is available when
using the [Quorum Developer Quickstart](../../tutorials/quorum-dev-quickstart/index.md).

If you add Splunk to your GoQuorum Quickstart network, all logs will be directed to the local Splunk container.
From there, you can search through the logs, view network metrics, and create custom dashboards with the data that you're
interested in.

To view the GoQuorum Quickstart network logs in Splunk:

1. [Start the Quorum Developer Quickstart with GoQuorum](../../tutorials/quorum-dev-quickstart/using-the-quickstart.md),
    selecting Splunk monitoring.
1. Open the Splunk UI at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).
