# Logs & Errors Consolidation

Although there is sufficient logging in Quorum (geth), the error messages are not always straightforward to decipher.
This is our take on cataloguing of error messages along with possible cause and remediation actions, to serve as a first point of reference before reaching out to the support team.

!!! note
    The log level “ERROR” is written out in uppercase as part of the log message and can be used for alert monitoring.

| Message & Parameters | Cause | Action |
| -------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| "Could not search for pattern", "pattern", pattern, "contract", contracts[types[i]], "err", err | Generated by `abigen` due to an internal error when generating ABI for a contract |  *Raise an issue ticket* |
| "account listing failed", "error", err | Call to Clef API method `account_list` failed |  *Depends on the error detail in the log message* |
| "operation SelfDerive not supported on external signers" | An unsupported operation was performed by an external wallet.  | |
| "Failed to enumerate smart card readers", "err", err | A failure occurred when scanning for smart card wallets. The logged message should contain further error details and determine the action to take.  | |
| "Failed to enumerate USB devices", "hub", hub.scheme, "vendor", hub.vendorID, "failcount", failcount, "err", err | A failure occurred when scanning for USB wallets. The logged message should contain further error details |  *Depends on the error detail in the log message, if not using USB wallets then add `--nousb` to command line* |
| "Import error", "err", err | Message is generated when using `geth import` and indicates an issue with the import file | |
| "Import error", "file", arg, "err", err | Message is generated when using `geth import` and indicates an issue with the named import file | |
| "Failed to retrieve signer address", "err", err | Message is generated when using `puppeth` and indicates an issue with signer JSON key file | |

## Impossible reorg issue

This can occur if there was an issue during sync. There are a number of potential causes:

- Node was not cleanly shutdown previously, causing database corruption
- An edge case where two sealers generate blocks at the exact same time (depends on consensus type in use)
- Insufficient resources (disk or memory)
- Some (unknown) issue during resync

The action to be taken will depend on the cause. Note that more recent versions of quorum may already include fixes to prevent some of these issues.

In the event of database corruption, see instructions below for [Resolution of database corruption issues](#resolution-of-database-corruption-issues).

## Bad block issue

This can occur if there was an issue when inserting a new block into the chain and is logged in the form:

```
########## BAD BLOCK #########
Chain config: %v
Number: %v
Hash: 0x%x
'transaction receipt'
Error: %v
##############################
```

The error detail gives more information as to the root cause. Here are a few possibilities and suggested actions:

- "invalid gas used":  This occurs if the local node calculates a different gas usage for transactions than the node which created the block. This may be due to a configuration issue.
- "insufficient balance to pay for gas":  This is similar to "invalid gas used", but occurs when there is insufficient gas to complete a transaction.
- "invalid merkle root":  Cause is usually a corrupted database or failed import. See instructions under the section on [Resolution of database corruption issues](#resolution-of-database-corruption-issues).
- "unknown ancestor":  This is usually due to an issue with fast sync. Restarting the node may resolve it.
- "blacklisted hash":  The cause and resolution of this is similar to the "Found bad hash, rewinding chain" error.

Note that more recent versions of quorum may already include fixes to prevent some of these issues.

## Resolution of database corruption issues

Corruption of the database (chain data) can occur due to lack of resources, or after a 'forced' shutdown. In some cases, quorum will recover automatically or require a restart of the failing node.

If the node does not recover then it may require the chaindata to be deleted and resynced.

The chain data can be removed by shutting down the node and running `geth removedb --datadir /path/to/data/directory`.

If raft consensus is in use, then the raft logs must also be removed before restarting the node, these consist of all directories containing `raft` under the data directory.
