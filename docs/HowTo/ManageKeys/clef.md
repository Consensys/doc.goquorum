# Using Clef

`clef` was introduced in Quorum `v2.6.0`.

Clef for GoQuorum is the standard `go-ethereum` `clef` tool, with additional support for GoQuorum-specific
features, including:

* Support for private transactions.
* Ability to extend functionality with [`account` plugins](AccountPlugins.md).

`clef` runs as a separate process to `geth` and provides an alternative method of managing accounts
and signing transactions/data.

Instead of `geth` loading and using accounts directly, `geth` delegates account management
responsibilities to `clef`.

!!!important
    Account management will be deprecated within `geth` in the future and replaced with `clef`.

Using `clef` instead of `geth` for account management has several benefits:

* Users and dapps no longer depend on access to a synchronized local node loaded with accounts.
* Transactions and dapp data can instead be signed using `clef`.
* Future account-related features will only be available in `clef` and not in `geth`.
    (For example, [EIP-191 and EIP-712 are implemented in `clef`, but there is no intention of implementing them in `geth`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/17789/).)
* User-experience improvements to ease use and improve security.

## Installing

You can install `geth` and all included tools (`clef`, `bootnode`, â€¦) to `PATH` by
[building GoQuorum from source with `make all`](../../GetStarted/Install.md).

Verify the installation with:

```bash
clef help
```

## Getting started

See [`cmd/clef/tutorial.md`](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum/blob/master/cmd/clef/tutorial.md)
for an overview and step-by-step guide on `clef` initialization, startup, and automation rules configuration.

## Using

`clef` can be used in one of two ways:

1. As an external signer.
1. As a `geth` signer.

!!! warning
    In the long term, the preferred way of using `clef` will be as an external signer. However, while
    waiting for `clef` API support, the `go-ethereum` project has included the option
    to use `clef` as a `geth` signer. This ensures existing tooling and user flows can remain unchanged.
    The option to use `clef` as a `geth` signer **will be deprecated** in a future release of `go-ethereum`
    once the migration of account management from `geth` to `clef` is complete.

### As an external signer

Using `clef` as an external signer requires interacting with `clef` through its RPC API. By default
this is exposed over IPC socket. The API can also be exposed over HTTP by using the `--rpcaddr` CLI flag.

!!!example

    An example workflow:

    1. Start `clef` and make your accounts available to it.
    1. Sign a transaction with the account by using `clef`'s `account_signTransaction` API.  `clef` returns the signed transaction.
    1. Use `eth_sendRawTransaction` or `eth_sendRawPrivateTransaction` to send the signed transaction to a GoQuorum node that doesn't have your accounts available to it.
    1. The GoQuorum node validates the transaction and propagates it through the network for minting.

    === "List accounts"

        ```bash
        echo '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "account_list"}' | nc -U /path/to/clef.ipc
        ```

    === "Sign data"

        ```bash
        echo '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "account_signData", "params": ["data/plain", "0x6038dc01869425004ca0b8370f6c81cf464213b3", "0xaaaaaa"]}' | nc -U /path/to/clef.ipc
        ```

### As a geth signer

Using `clef` as a `geth` signer does not require direct interaction through the `clef` API. Instead
`geth` can be used as normal and will automatically delegate to `clef`.

To use `clef` as a `geth` signer:

1. Start `clef`.
1. Start `geth` with the `--signer /path/to/clef.ipc` CLI flag.

An example workflow:

1. Start `clef` and make your accounts available to it.
1. Start `geth` and do not make your accounts available to it.
1. Use `eth_sendTransaction` to sign and submit a transaction for validation, propagation, and minting.

### Extending with account plugins

By default, `clef` manages file-stored `keystore` accounts.
You can enable alternative account management options using [`account` plugins](AccountPlugins.md).

```bash
clef --plugins file:///path/to/plugin-config.json
```
