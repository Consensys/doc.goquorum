# Account plugins

## For developers

You can develop new `account` plugins to extend the supported account management options for GoQuorum and `clef`.

`account` plugins must follow the [gRPC API interface requirements](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-plugin-definitions/blob/master/account.proto).

To simplify the development of new `account` plugins, the following `account` plugin SDKs are available:

| Name | Language |
| --- | --- |
| [quorum-account-plugin-sdk-go](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-account-plugin-sdk-go) | Go |

## For users

See [how to use `account` plugins](../../develop/manage-keys/account-plugins.md).
