# Privacy Enhancements

From GoQuorum v20.10.0, two privacy enhancements are included to prevent state divergence:

* Counter party protection
* Private state validation

## Counter party protection

Counter party protection prevents non-participants sending a transaction to a
private contract. For example, a private contract is deployed between node 1 and 2. Without counter
party protection, if node 3 discovers the private contract address, node 3 can send a transaction with
`privateFor` set to node 2. The transaction is not applied on node 3 because it is not a participant
in the private transaction. The transaction submitted by non-participating node 3 is applied to the
private state on node 2.

Use the counter party protection instead of access controls on private contract implementations to protect
against other network participants from updating the state. Counter party protection prevents non-participants
from interacting with the private contract without additional access controls.

## Private state validation

Private state validation prevents state divergence by ensuring that any private transaction
for the contract is always sent to all participants. For example, a private contract is deployed between node 1 and 2.
Without private state validation, node 1 can send a transaction to the private contract with a `privateFor`
of `[]`. The transaction changes the private state of node 1 but not node 2 and the private states of
1 and 2 no longer match. With private state validation, a transaction from node 1 with a `privateFor`
of `[]` is rejected and the transaction is processed only when `privateFor` contains both 1 and 2

When using private state validation, the full participant list is shared among all participants and
validated against all subsequent transactions. Transactions sent to a subset of participants fail.

In standard privacy or when only using counter party protection, only the sending node knows
the full participant list.

## Affected Contract Original Transaction Payload Hash

Counter party protection and private state validation are implemented using the Affected Contract
Original Transaction Payload Hash (`ACOTH`). To transact with a private contract, a node must prove
it has access (that is, it has the encrypted payload and the ability to decrypt it) to the originating
transaction for the contract.

## Key Enhancements

### Privacy Flag

A new parameter `PrivacyFlag` has been added to all GoQuorum
[`send` API methods](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#privacy-methods), being passed from the client to enable the privacy
enhancements feature.
This flag is an unsigned integer set to 1 for PP and 3 for PSV transactions.
If the flag is missing or zero, the transaction is assumed to be a "non-privacy enhanced" SP transaction.

### Privacy Metadata and Privacy Metadata Trie

Privacy Metadata is a new structure introduced in GoQuorum. It is stored in the GoQuorum DB in the privacy
metadata trie (which is linked to the private state via root hash mappings). The Privacy Metadata contains
the ACOTH and privacyFlag.

Privacy Metadata Trie is a parallel trie that stores the privacy metadata (and whatever extra data we
may need) for the private contracts and is linked to the private state by root hash mappings. The records
in the trie are keyed by the contract address (similarly to how the contract/accounts data is stored
in the state trie).

Each contract(account) that is created as the result of a PP or PSV transaction would have such a structure
attached to the privacy metadata trie as it is essential in performing checks on future transactions
affecting those contracts.

### Transaction simulation

In order to discover what ACOTH(s) to attach to a transaction the GoQuorum node simulates the execution
of the proposed transaction. The result of the simulation relies on the current state of the chain.
The Ethereum VM has been enhanced to track the contracts involved in the simulated transaction.
At the end of the simulation the EVM can report all the created/invoked contract addresses.
Coupled with the privacy metadata described above it is easy to translate contract addresses to ACOTHs
and attach them to the proposed transaction.

#### Limitations

Depending on the complexity of the contracts and the throughput of the network it may happen that the
state at simulation time may differ from the chain state at the time the proposed transaction is minted.
If the state at minting time is sufficiently altered to determine different contract interactions the
corresponding PP/PSV transactions would be marked as failed on all the participants.
Furthermore, since state divergence is expected in PP contracts, it is possible (depending on contract design)
for PP transactions to fail on some of the participants.

Concurrency may also present a problem for PSV contracts. The execution hash calculation is based on
the chain state at simulation time. Submitting multiple transactions to the same PSV contract from multiple
nodes concurrently is likely to result in most of the transactions failing.

Considering the above we expect users to choose PP and PSV contracts/transactions **only** when th
enhanced privacy is necessary (and the extra privacy benefits outweigh the potential shortfalls).

### Contract/Transaction interactions

No interactions are allowed between the different types of private contracts/transactions. The only type
of allowed interaction is for private contracts (SP/PP/PSV) to read from public contracts.

![Contract interaction matrix](../../images/PrivacyEnhancements_Contract_Interaction_Matrix.png)

The privacy enhancements feature only performs it’s checks on submitted/minted transactions.
None of the above limitations apply to calls (read only transactions). In this context calls are contract
method invocations that are executed locally and do not result in minted transactions.

## Configuration Changes

### GoQuorum

`genesis.json` file has been modified to include `privacyEnhancementsBlock`. The values for this should
be set to an appropriate value in the future (and should be initialised with same value across all the nodes
in the network) by when the entire network would be ready to transact with privacy enhanced contracts/transactions.

### Tessera

New flag `enablePrivacyEnhancements` has been added to Tessera config defaulting to `FALSE`, and can
be enabled by adding the property to the config file the same way as other features.
Refer sample configuration for further details.

## Enabling Privacy Enhancements in the GoQuorum Network

For any given node the privacy manager (Tessera) is started first and for that reason we allow the Tessera
node to be upgraded with privacy enhancements support ahead of GoQuorum upgrade. But when GoQuorum node
is upgraded and `geth` is reinitialized with `privacyEnhancementsBlock`, GoQuorum node will validate the
version of Tessera running and will fail to start if Tessera is not running an upgraded version. The
GoQuorum node reports an appropriate error message in the console suggesting users to upgrade Tessera first.

If a node wants to upgrade it's Tessera to privacy enhancements release (or further) to avail other
features and fixes but not ready to upgrade GoQuorum, it can do so by not enabling `enablePrivacyEnhancements`
in Tessera config. This will allow the node to reject PP and PSV transactions from other nodes until
the node is ready to support privacy enhanced contracts/transactions.

## Backward compatability

### GoQuorum

An upgraded GoQuorum node can coexist on a network where other nodes are running on lower version of
GoQuorum and thus supports node by node upgrade. But it cannot support privacy enhanced contracts until
all interested nodes are upgraded and privacy is enabled.
If an upgraded but privacy not "enabled" node receives a PSV or PP transaction the node would log a
`BAD BLOCK` error with “Privacy enhanced transaction received while privacy enhancements are disabled.
Please check your node configuration.” error message. If the consensus algorithm is Raft, the node would stop.
For Istanbul, the node would keep trying to append the problematic block and reprint the above errors and
it won't catch up with rest of nodes until restarted and reinitialized with the correct `privacyEnhancementsBlock`.

### Tessera

On any given node, Tessera can be upgraded to privacy enhanced release at anytime.
Take care when you enable `enablePrivacyEnhancements` flag in Tessera config as it will accept PSV and
PP transactions and can cause the node to crash if GoQuorum node is not privacy enabled.
The upgraded node can continue to communicate on Tessera nodes running on previous versions using SP transactions.
API versioning <!-- TODO: add hyperlink later --> (that will be introduced along with privacy enhancements)
enables the upgraded node to determine if the receiving node supports privacy enhancements and fail the transaction if not.

## Tessera P2P communication changes

Refer [here](PrivateTransactionLifecycle.md) to refresh about Tessera P2P communication.

### Party Protection changes

To prevent a non-party node from interacting with PP contracts new transactions must be submitted with
`ACOTHs` and `PrivacyFlag` from GoQuorum to Tessera. The Tessera node would then generate proofs
(a hash using new transaction ciphertext, original transaction ciphertext and original transaction master key)
for each ACOTH and include a) `PrivacyFlag`, b) ACOTHs and c) ACOTH proofs (secure hashes) in the transaction
payload shared between Tessera nodes.

### Private State Validation changes

Besides the ACOTH, a PSV transaction has an execution hash (Merkle root) calculated from all the affected
contract(s) resulting from the transaction simulation (at the time of submission) included from GoQuorum
to Tessera. The d) execution hash and e) list of participants are also shared between Tessera nodes.

## Privacy Enhanced Transaction End to End Flow

Refer [to the private transaction livecycle](PrivateTransactionLifecycle.md) documentation for end to end flow of SP transaction.

![Privacy enhanced transaction end to end flow](../../images/PrivacyEnhancements.png)

In this example we walk through the flow of a private transaction on a "privacy enhanced contract" between Nodes A & B.

1. User pushing a private transaction from Node A private for Node B

    * The transaction payload will include the `PrivacyFlag` with value `1` for PP and `3` for PSV contract

1. Node A GoQuorum reading the `PrivacyFlag` runs an EVM transaction simulation to gather all the affected
contracts and the ACOTH(s) associated to contract accounts. For PSV transactions, it also calculates
an execution hash (Merkle root) from all the affected contracts resulting from the transaction simulation.

1. Node A GoQuorum pushes the transaction payload, `PrivacyFlag`, ACOTHs (& the Merkle root for PSV) to Node A Tessera.

1. Node A Tessera generates proofs (secure hashes) for the ACOTHs and use them to validate that the
originating party has access to all relevant transactions.
In addition for PSV it would also verify the participants list against the list in each of the ACOTH
transactions (as in PSV transactions the recipient list is shared across all nodes party to the transaction).
If the list doesn't match it will return failure on `/send` to Node A GoQuorum.

1. Node A Tessera pushes to Node B Tessera the encrypted payload, ACOTH <-> proofs (secure hash) mappings
(for PSV transaction it will also push the `privateFor` list and Merkle root).

1. Node B Tessera computes and compares proofs (secure hash) from Node A Tessera (for PSV it also verifies
participants list of ACOTHs against the `privateFor` list).

1. Node B Tessera returns a SUCCESS response to Node A Tessera - even if the compute and compare mismatched
(in order to prevent Node A finding out the recipient list of a contract/transaction) but it will not
store the payload/ACOTH <--> Securehash mapping based on the outcome.

1. Node A Tessera returns the hash for the encrypted transaction payload to Node A GoQuorum

1. Node A mines the transaction across the network.

1. Node A & Node B being party to the contract will `/receive` decrypted payload, ACOTHs (for PSV also
Merkle root) from the respective Tessera Nodes.

1. Both Nodes execute the transaction and compare the ACOTHs (and execution hash for PSV) and update
the transaction receipt accordingly to mark transaction execution completion.

!!! note
    If the EVM simulation impacts more than one contract, all contracts should have the same `PrivacyFlag`,
    otherwise the transaction is rejected.
    All contracts ACOTHs are included in the transmission and the Tessera node will create individual
    proofs (secure hash) for each ACOTH.**
