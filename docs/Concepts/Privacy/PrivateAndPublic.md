# Public and Private Transactions

GoQuorum achieves transaction privacy by:

1. Enabling transaction senders to create private transactions by marking who is privy to a transaction via the
  `privateFor` parameter.

1. Storing encrypted private data off-chain in a separate component called the
  [private transaction manager](PrivateTransactionManager.md).
  The private transaction manager encrypts private data, distributes the encrypted data to other parties that are privy
  to the transaction, and returns the decrypted payload to those parties.

1. Replacing the payload of a private transaction with a hash of the encrypted payload, such that the original payload
   is not visible to participants who are not privy to the transaction.

!!! note

    While GoQuorum introduces the notion of "public transactions" and "private transactions," it does not introduce new
    transaction types.
    Rather, it extends the Ethereum transaction model to include an optional `privateFor` parameter (the inclusion of
    which results in GoQuorum treating a transaction as private) and the transaction type has a new `IsPrivate` method to
    identify private transactions.

## Public transactions

Public transactions have payloads that are visible to all participants of the same network.
These are
[created as standard Ethereum transactions](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethsendtransaction).

Examples of public transactions include market data updates from a service provider, or a reference data update such as
a correction to a bond security definition.

!!! Note

    GoQuorum public transactions are not transactions from the public Ethereum network.
    Perhaps a more appropriate term would be "common" or "global" transactions, but "public" is used to contrast with
    "private" transactions.

## Private transactions

Private transactions have payloads that are visible only to the network participants whose public keys are specified in
the `privateFor` parameter of the Transaction.
`privateFor` can take multiple addresses in a comma separated list.
(See
[Creating private transactions/contracts](../../HowTo/Use/DevelopingSmartContracts.md#creating-private-transactionscontracts).)

!!! note

    `privateFor` is not shared with other participants; it's only used to know which nodes to send the encrypted payload.

When a GoQuorum node encounters a transaction with a non-null `privateFor` value, it sets the `v` value of the
transaction signature to `37` or `38` (as opposed to public transactions, whose `v` values are set according to
[EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md)).

## Public vs private transaction handling

Public transactions are executed in the standard Ethereum way.
If a public transaction is sent to an account that holds contract code, each participant executes the same code, and
their StateDBs are updated accordingly.

Private transactions are executed differently: before the sender's GoQuorum node propagating the transaction to the
rest of the network, the node replaces the original transaction payload with a hash of the encrypted payload that it
receives from Tessera.
Participants that are privy to the transaction are able to replace the hash with the actual payload via their Tessera
instance, while participants not privy only see the hash.

The result is that if a private transaction is sent to an account that holds contract code, participants not privy to
the transaction skip the transaction and don't execute the contract code.
However, participants privy to the transaction replace the hash with the original payload before calling the EVM for
execution, and their StateDBs update accordingly.
These two sets of participants therefore end up with different StateDBs and aren't able to reach consensus.
To support this forking of contract state, GoQuorum stores the state of public contracts in a public state trie that
is globally synchronized, and it stores the state of private contracts in a private state trie that is not globally
synchronized.
