# Blockchain Introduction

## What is a blockchain?

Blockchain is a shared and immutable electronic ledger (or digital database) that keeps a record of transactional data.
It's synonymous to a shared document in the cloud that multiple people can access from anywhere in the world and
update which makes it decentralized. Blockchains distributed nature means that they store information across a network
of computers (or nodes) and data isn't owned by a single entity, but by everyone on the network.

The *block* in a blockchain refers to a block of transactions that has been broadcast to the network. The *chain*
refers to a string of these blocks. When a new block of transactions is validated by the network, it is attached to the
end of an existing chain. This chain of blocks is an ever-growing list, or ledger, of transactions that the network has
validated. Formally we call this single, agreed-upon history of transactions a blockchain.

## What problems do Blockchains solve?

Today on the Internet, we must constantly trust one another with sensitive data, transactions, and records. Most of our
interactions on the Internet run on centralized web servers, and massive amounts of user data often exist in a single
database, for example banks. Current databases are designed to be controlled by *trusted* admins who can read, alter,
block, or even delete data. The centralized architecture of the Internet today is vulnerable to censorship and
targeted attacks by both hackers and internal bad actors.

## Why is a blockchain important to my business?

Business require information quickly, reliably and securely to function and build trust with their customers.
Blockchains are ideal for businesses because they provide finality of data on the chain that is distributed,
transparent( and can be verified) and shared with all members. It avoids the hassles of duplication of data as well
as source of truth problems coupled with multiple systems each vulnerable to cyberattacks or fraud.

Blockchain networks are secure distributed ledgers that are ideal for asset tracking, payments and accounts, supply chain,
logistics and so many other fields. They help make your business smoother and effecient, allowing you to focus on what
matters to you and grow your business
