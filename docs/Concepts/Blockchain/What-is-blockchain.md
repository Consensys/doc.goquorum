# Blockchain Introduction

## What is a blockchain?

Blockchain is a shared and immutable electronic ledger (or digital database) that keeps a record of transactional data.
Blockchains are often termed **decentralized** which means that they store data across a network of members who
collaborate to monitor and run the network. The system as such cannot be owned a single entity, but rather by
everyone on the network.

The *block* in a blockchain refers to a block of transactions that has been broadcast to the network. The *chain*
refers to a string of these blocks in chronological order. When a new block of transactions is **securely** validated
by the network, it is attached to the end of an existing chain. This chain of blocks is an ever-growing list, or ledger,
of transactions, each of which can be traced and this lends to **accountability** and **transparency** which isn't
available on traditional ledgers.

## What problems do Blockchains solve?

We live in a highly transactional world, where we must constantly trust one another with sensitive data, transactions
and records. Most of our interactions on the Internet run on centralized web servers (banks for example) and massive
amounts of user data often exist in a single database. This poses a few risks because current databases are designed to
be controlled by *trusted* admins who can read, alter, block, or even delete data. In addition, the centralized
architecture of the Internet today is vulnerable to censorship and targeted attacks by both hackers and internal bad actors.

The value of a blockchain is the certainty of the network: participants can establish a trusted and immutable record of
transactions without the need for intermediaries. The decentralized architecture of a blockchain - a global network of
computers simultaneously running the software and validating the chain of transactions is what ensures that the
transaction record is never compromised. It makes a blockchain network less likely to fail, harder to attack, and
harder for bad actors to game the system.

## Why do I need a blockchain for my business?

Blockchains bring out a new model of doing business where networks have standard methods for establishing identity of
all members participating on the network but also for transactions and storing of data. Essentially it works to foster
trust between members with the decentralized structure of the network and with the improved security both via encryption
and immutable blocks. Compared to traditional systems, privacy concerns of members is better addressed by anonymyzing
data and requiring permissions to limit access. The visibility and traceability of transactions is also a key benefit of
blockchains empowering businesses to track the origins of an asset accurately and maintain inventory and quality of
goods.

The biggest benefit is the opportunities that arise for business's to grow and collaborate. In some cases, multiple
organizations come together and create a **consortium network** to work towards a shared goal where terms and
permissions are agreed on and set out as policies which are then deployed to the blockchain. The policies generally
evolve over time and are updated as required after all members have agreed on them.

Blockchains help make your business smoother and effecient, allowing you to focus on what matters to you and grow
your business
