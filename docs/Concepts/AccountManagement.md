# Account/key management

Cryptographic keys are an essential component of a GoQuorum network. GoQuorum uses keys to create digital
signatures which verify a sender's identity and prevent message tampering. The Privacy Manager uses keys to encrypt private transaction data.

Both GoQuorum and the Privacy Manager use user-provided asymmetric key pairs. Each key pair consists
of a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared freely, but **the private key should never be shared**.

* GoQuorum derives the account address from the public key by taking the last 20 bytes of its keccak256 hash
* The Privacy Manager uses the public key as an identifier for the target nodes of a private transaction (that is the `privateFor` transaction field)

Key management determines how [GoQuorum](../HowTo/ManageKeys/ManagingKeys.md) and [Tessera](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net)
store and use private keys.
