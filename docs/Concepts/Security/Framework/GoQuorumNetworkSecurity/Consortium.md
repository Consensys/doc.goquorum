# Consortium

When creating a consortium, take the following elements into consideration:

## Governance

The governance structure you choose must not only permit efficient and effective operations of the consortium, but also
fulfill the concerns of participants equally.

## Ownership

The nature of blockchain technology increases the risk of accidental data exposure.
To manage this risk, ownership of intellectual property and assets should be documented and agreed upon.

## Liability

Most but not all network operational activities are benign.

Even in an otherwise low-risk consortium, where the membership constitutes "market power" under the antitrust laws, a
significant percentage of the competitors in a given product or service space might be members.
The potential for mistakes and government scrutiny is higher.

In this situation, individual members may wish to maintain tighter control over what the organization and its members
can (and can't) do without prior consensus in order to reduce the risk and liability.

## Activities

Interconnecting multiple independent networks comes with risk factors.
To minimize risk, document the activities expected to be performed in the network.

## Security checklist

- Use a Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol in case nodes are managed by non-trusted participants.

- Consortium members should provide a reasonable network Service-Level Agreement (SLA).

- Ensure private/public payload data is stored in an appropriate geographical legislation area.

- Document the consortium governance structure, ownership, liability, memberships, and activities.

- Document the organizational and technological requirements to join the consortium.

- Ensure consortium members are known to every participant in the network.

- Ensure private/public payload data is compliant with privacy policies.
